# NN-Flappy-Birds
Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Â© C++ &amp; SDL2 - Flappy Birds with NN and genetic selection

This is an implementation of a challenge from Mr Daniel Shiffman : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6y21FkaUqw

SDL2 must have bee downloaded and Visual Studio configured to use it.

Version of SDL2 used : 2.26.2 (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/download/release-2.26.2/SDL2-devel-2.26.2-VC.zip)
I just decompressed it under C:\Users\pascal\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\libraries

Just compile and run the program to see a very simple graphic representation of Flappy Birds evolving over generations.
